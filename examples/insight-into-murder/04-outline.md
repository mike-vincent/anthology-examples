**CBS Radio Mystery Theater**

## Plot Synopsis

In "CBS Radio Mystery Theater," lawyer Terence Pierce is drawn into a murder case eerily similar to one from 1810. Convinced that Sybil Harrison's murder mirrors that of Lady Sybil Millbrook, Terence believes Seward Black is framing Philip Donato, just as Sir Seward had done in the past. Despite skepticism, Terence, supported by his wife Meg, delves into historical records, linking the two crimes. In Arizona, they visit friends Kim and George Parrish, where Terence's déjà vu intensifies. With help from Ben, who secretly investigates, Terence confronts Black. The confrontation reveals Black's guilt in both murders, confirming Terence's insights into the past. Black confesses, admitting he framed others, including Donato and a vagrant in 1810. Ben and the police apprehend Black, using evidence from the maid's testimony and drugged coffee pot. Terence's journey into history uncovers the truth, proving his visions were genuine insights into the murder.
